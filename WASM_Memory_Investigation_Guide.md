# WASM Game Memory Investigation Guide

## üéØ Goal
Extract score values from a WebAssembly (WASM) game running in a browser by reading memory addresses.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- **Chrome Browser** (latest version with WASM debugging support)
- **Python 3.7+** with packages:
  ```bash
  pip install selenium pyautogui psutil
  ```
- **ChromeDriver** (automatically managed by Selenium)

### Optional Tools
- **C/C++ DevTools Support (DWARF) Extension** for advanced WASM debugging
- **Memory analysis tools** like Cheat Engine (for comparison)

## üîç Investigation Methods

### Method 1: Chrome DevTools Memory Inspector (Recommended)

This is the most reliable and user-friendly approach.

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Open the Game**
   - Navigate to your WASM game in Chrome
   - Ensure the game is fully loaded

2. **Open DevTools**
   - Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
   - Go to the **Sources** tab

3. **Find WASM Files**
   - Look for `.wasm` files in the file tree
   - These contain the compiled WebAssembly code

4. **Set Breakpoints**
   - Click on line numbers in the WASM disassembly to set breakpoints
   - Alternatively, use the **Pause on exceptions** feature

5. **Trigger Execution**
   - Play the game to trigger the breakpoint
   - The debugger will pause execution

6. **Access Memory Inspector**
   - In the **Scope** panel (right side), look for:
     - `env.memory`
     - `WebAssembly.Memory`
     - Memory-related objects
   - Right-click on memory object ‚Üí **"Reveal in Memory Inspector panel"**

7. **Find Your Score**
   - Change your game score to a recognizable value (e.g., 12345)
   - In Memory Inspector, navigate through memory addresses
   - Look for your score value in different formats:
     - **Decimal**: Direct number representation
     - **Hexadecimal**: Base-16 representation
     - **ASCII**: Text representation (if applicable)

8. **Note the Address**
   - When you find your score, note the memory address (e.g., `0x00001234`)
   - This address will be used for continuous monitoring

#### Memory Inspector Features:
- **Address Navigation**: Jump to specific memory addresses
- **Data Format Toggle**: View as integers, floats, bytes
- **Endianness Control**: Switch between big-endian and little-endian
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific values

### Method 2: JavaScript Memory Access

This method uses JavaScript injection to programmatically access WASM memory.

#### How It Works:
1. **Inject JavaScript** into the game page
2. **Find WASM Instances** by scanning global objects
3. **Access Memory Buffer** through WebAssembly.Memory
4. **Search for Values** using typed arrays (Int32Array, Float32Array)

#### Code Example:
```javascript
// Find WASM instances
function findWasmInstances() {
    const instances = [];
    for (let key in window) {
        try {
            if (window[key] && window[key].exports && window[key].exports.memory) {
                instances.push({
                    name: key,
                    memory: window[key].exports.memory,
                    instance: window[key]
                });
            }
        } catch (e) {
            // Ignore access errors
        }
    }
    return instances;
}

// Search for a specific value
function searchMemoryForValue(memory, targetValue) {
    const view = new Int32Array(memory.buffer);
    const results = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < view.length; i++) {
        if (view[i] === targetValue) {
            results.push({
                address: i * 4,
                value: view[i]
            });
        }
    }
    return results;
}
```

### Method 3: Pattern Analysis

When you can't find the exact score value, analyze memory patterns.

#### Process:
1. **Take Memory Snapshots** at different score values
2. **Compare Changes** between snapshots
3. **Identify Patterns** (increasing values, consistent locations)
4. **Filter Candidates** based on typical score characteristics

#### What to Look For:
- **Increasing Values**: Scores typically increase over time
- **Reasonable Ranges**: Scores are usually within expected bounds
- **Consistent Locations**: Score addresses don't change frequently
- **Data Type Patterns**: Scores are often integers or floats

### Method 4: Continuous Monitoring

Once you've found the score address, monitor it continuously.

#### Implementation:
```python
def monitor_score(driver, memory_address):
    while True:
        score = driver.execute_script(f"""
            const wasmInstances = findWasmInstances();
            if (wasmInstances.length > 0) {{
                const memory = wasmInstances[0].memory;
                const view = new Int32Array(memory.buffer);
                return view[{memory_address} / 4];
            }}
            return null;
        """)
        
        print(f"Current Score: {score}")
        time.sleep(1)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: No WASM Memory Found
**Symptoms**: JavaScript can't find WebAssembly instances
**Solutions**:
- Check if the game actually uses WebAssembly
- Look for different memory access patterns
- Try accessing memory through different global objects

### Issue 2: Memory Access Denied
**Symptoms**: JavaScript throws security errors
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're running on the same origin
- Check for Content Security Policy restrictions
- Try using browser extensions for elevated access

### Issue 3: Score Value Not Found
**Symptoms**: Memory search returns no results
**Solutions**:
- Try different data types (int32, float32, int16)
- Search for encoded or transformed values
- Look for the score in different number bases
- Consider that the score might be stored as a string

### Issue 4: Address Changes Between Sessions
**Symptoms**: Previously found addresses no longer work
**Solutions**:
- WASM memory layout can change between loads
- Use pattern analysis to find the new address
- Look for relative offsets from known structures

## üìä Data Types and Formats

### Common Score Storage Formats:
- **32-bit Integer** (`Int32Array`): Most common for integer scores
- **32-bit Float** (`Float32Array`): For scores with decimal places
- **16-bit Integer** (`Int16Array`): For smaller score ranges
- **64-bit Integer** (`BigInt64Array`): For very large scores

### Memory Layout Considerations:
- **Endianness**: Little-endian vs big-endian byte order
- **Alignment**: Values might be aligned to 4-byte or 8-byte boundaries
- **Padding**: Extra bytes between data structures

## üîí Security and Ethical Considerations

### Legal Considerations:
- Only analyze games you own or have permission to modify
- Respect terms of service and end-user license agreements
- Don't use this for cheating in online multiplayer games

### Technical Limitations:
- Some games use obfuscation or encryption
- Anti-cheat systems may detect memory analysis
- Browser security features may block access

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### 1. Memory Mapping
Create a map of the entire WASM memory space to understand data structures.

### 2. Reverse Engineering
Use tools like Ghidra or IDA Pro to analyze the WASM binary offline.

### 3. Dynamic Analysis
Monitor memory changes in real-time to understand game logic.

### 4. Pointer Following
If the score is stored via pointers, follow the pointer chain to find the actual value.

## üìù Example Workflow

1. **Setup**: Run the Python script with your game URL
2. **Initial Discovery**: Use Method 1 (DevTools) to manually find the score
3. **Automation**: Use Method 2 (JavaScript) to programmatically access the score
4. **Monitoring**: Use Method 3 to continuously track score changes
5. **Integration**: Incorporate the score reading into your automation system

## üéØ Success Indicators

You've successfully found the score when:
- ‚úÖ The memory value matches your current game score
- ‚úÖ The value updates when your score changes
- ‚úÖ The address remains consistent during gameplay
- ‚úÖ You can read the value programmatically
